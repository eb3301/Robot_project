### Current issues regarding mapping

- The map file is being created successfully, but the detected objects are inconsistently placed. Objects often appear in incorrect locations, and the detection system frequently misidentifies items—such as bags or hands—or merges multiple objects into one. This results in an inaccurate representation of object positions on the map.
- Once object detection is improved, generating an accurate map should be straightforward using the current implementation.

# Status:
Wait for detection. 

# Current work:
Occumṕancy grid node
