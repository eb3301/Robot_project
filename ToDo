Exploration: 
how do we choose points and how do we decide which points to explore
Johan: sample points in free space close to unknown and clear bit for bit
how do we define objects and borders (occupancy grid or separate file)
what is limit for detection distance
how do we handle duplicates
how do we publish the objects
how do we handle colission avoidance

Needs to be fixed:
-- I don't think we are inflating objects found by lidar that is not part of the border
-- Replanning when we are in occupied space
-- Publish objects on map

Collection:
How to decide what object to pick first
how do we know when to stop (when rgbd does not see?)
how do we update grid when stuff is picked or found in wrong place
how to handle when two objects are next to eachother
how do we handle when an object is not where we expect it to be
